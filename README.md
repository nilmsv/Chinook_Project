In this project, chinook database has been investigated and analyzed.
Purpuse:
Understanding the database and writing SQL queries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Statistical analysis.
Data visualization and dashboard creation.

SQL queries:
In this section, in order to understand the database design and write SQL queries to extract related data, some questions related to this database have been answered.

EDA:
In this section, in order to discover patterns, trends and anomalies in the data, analysis have been made on this database with the help of pandas library.

dashboard:
In this section, with the help of Power Bi, a dashboard is designed to create interaction.
